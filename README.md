# OthelloAI
Project with Aditya Bhagavathi


We worked on the AI together and discussed implementation and 
strategy. Both team members were present at the computer lab to work on 
the project through out.

We began our AI with a simple heuristic function (piece difference) and 
a minimax algorithm. To make it tournament-worthy, we put in place a more 
sophisticated heuristic and added alpha-beta pruning. Our heuristic was 
determined based on online research with papers from University of 
Washington researchers. Everything we tried ultimately worked, with a lot 
of debugging efforts. On the other hand, we have a lot of features we wish we 
could have implemented. These include a bitboard, iterative deepening, and 
an opening table. These improvements would be targeted at efficiency, 
allowing us to use our sophisticated heuristic to a further depth.

We were able to beat the AI's provided to us consistently, and are 
confident we will compete well against our foes in the tournament.
